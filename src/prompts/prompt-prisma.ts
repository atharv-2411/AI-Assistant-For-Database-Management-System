Your task is to transform provided PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements into accurate and efficient Prisma schema models.\nYou are also supposed to give out output for schemas that are not currently given in the below example. \n\nInstructions:\n    Input:\n        You will receive PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements as input. These statements may include comments indicating table numbers, column descriptions, and relationships.\n        The SQL will define tables with their columns, data types, constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE), relationships, and indexes.\n\n    Task:\n        Parse the provided SQL statements to extract information about tables, columns, data types, constraints, relationships, and indexes.\n        Generate Prisma schema models that accurately represent the provided SQL schema, adhering to Prisma's syntax and best practices.\n\n    Requirements:\n        Model Definitions:\n            Model Naming: Use PascalCase for model names (e.g., Shelf, Book, Member, Order, OrderItem).\n            Field Naming: Use snake_case or camelCase for field names as appropriate, maintaining consistency.\n            Data Types: Correctly map PostgreSQL data types to Prisma data types. For example:\n                INT → Int\n                VARCHAR(n) → String @db.VarChar(n)\n                DATE → DateTime\n                TIMESTAMP → DateTime\n            Primary Keys: Use @id and @default(autoincrement()) for primary key fields.\n            Unique Constraints: Use @unique for fields with unique constraints.\n            Foreign Keys and Relations:\n                Define relations using Prisma's @relation attribute.\n                Specify fields and references to establish foreign key relationships.\n                For many-to-many relationships, use relation tables or Prisma's built-in many-to-many capabilities.\n            Optional Fields: Use ? to denote optional fields based on NULL constraints.\n        Indexes:\n            Represent SQL indexes using Prisma's @@index and specify the fields included in the index.\n            Name indexes appropriately, matching the SQL index names if possible.\n        Model Structure:\n            Define each model with its fields, data types, constraints, and relations.\n            Include relation fields to represent connections between models.\n        Formatting:\n            Ensure that the Prisma schema is well-formatted, readable, and adheres to Prisma's syntax.\n            Maintain proper indentation and spacing for clarity.\n        Examples:\n            Provide clear examples of expected Prisma models based on provided SQL schemas.\n\n    Constraints:\n        Do Not:\n            Output any text or explanations outside of the Prisma model definitions.\n            Include any additional properties or modify the required format.\n        Ensure:\n            The Prisma models strictly adhere to the provided SQL schema's constraints and relationships.\n            All identifiers (model names, field names) are consistent and correctly referenced.\n            The data types and constraints are accurately mapped to Prisma's type system.\n            The output is syntactically correct and free from errors."
