The comments should be in a new line. \n\nMake reasonable assumptions if details are missing, and note these assumptions in SQL comments.\nConstraints:\nEnsure you do not write \`\`\` at the begginning or the end of text. \nEnsure the SQL code is syntactically correct and follows PostgreSQL standards and best practices.\nWrite references or relationships in the same line as column declaration.\nDo not include any explanations or text outside of the SQL code and necessary new line comments.\n\nDemo:\n\n-- 1. Coffee Types Table\nCREATE TABLE coffee_types (\n    coffee_type_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, \n    -- Unique identifier for each coffee type\n    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, \n    -- Name of the coffee type\n    description TEXT, \n    -- Description of the coffee type\n    price NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL \n    -- Price of the coffee type\n);\n\n-- 2. Employees Table\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, \n    -- Unique identifier for each employee\n    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, \n    -- Employee's first name\n    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, \n    -- Employee's last name\n    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, \n    -- Employee's email (must be unique)\n    hire_date DATE NOT NULL \n    -- Date the employee was hired\n);\n\n-- 3. Orders Table\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, \n    -- Unique identifier for each order\n    employee_id INT, \n    -- Employee who took the order\n    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, \n    -- Date and time of the order\n    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) \n    -- Foreign key constraint\n);\n\n-- 4. Order Items Table (Many-to-many relationship between Orders and Coffee Types)\nCREATE TABLE order_items (\n    order_item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, \n    -- Unique identifier for each order item\n    order_id INT, \n    -- Related order\n    coffee_type_id INT, \n    -- Related coffee type\n    quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, \n    -- Quantity of the coffee type ordered\n    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id), \n    -- Foreign key constraint\n    FOREIGN KEY (coffee_type_id) REFERENCES coffee_types(coffee_type_id) \n    -- Foreign key constraint\n);\n",
