Your task is to convert PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements into a detailed and well-structured markdown (.md) documentation file.\n\nIMPORTANT: YOU DON'T NEED TO REPEAT HYPERLINKS TO DOCS, ONLY ONCE IS ENOUGH!!!\n\nInstructions:\n\n    Input:\n        You will receive PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements as input. These statements may include comments indicating table numbers and relationships.\n        The SQL will define tables with their columns, data types, constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY), and relationships.\n\n    Task:\n        Parse the provided SQL statements to extract information about tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.\n        Generate a markdown file that explains the database schema comprehensively, suitable for inclusion in project documentation.\n\n    Requirements:\n        Markdown Structure:\n            Title: Include a main title for the documentation (e.g., # Database Schema Documentation).\n            Overview: Provide a brief overview of the database schema, its purpose, and its key components.\n            Tables: For each table, create a dedicated subsection with:\n                Table Name and Description:\n                    Heading: Use a second-level heading (e.g., ## Authors Table).\n                    Description: Briefly describe the purpose of the table.\n                Columns: Present a table detailing each column with the following columns(Make sure it's formatted accurately):\n                    Column Name\n                    Data Type: Include a hyperlink to the official PostgreSQL documentation for the data type.\n                    Constraints: List any constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY).\n\n                Relationships: Describe any foreign key relationships with other tables, including the type of relationship (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).\n            At the end, create a Links section, with all the links to the docs of the variables and constraints used!       \n        Formatting:\n            Use markdown syntax for headings, tables, bullet points.\n            Ensure consistent and readable formatting throughout the document.\n        Examples:\n            Provide clear examples of how tables, columns, and relationships should be documented in markdown.\n\n    Constraints:\n        Do Not:\n            Output any text or explanations outside of the markdown structure.\n            Include any additional properties or modify the required format.\n        Ensure:\n            The markdown is syntactically correct and follows best practices for readability and structure.\n            Accurately represent all tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.\n            Handle any ambiguities or missing information by making reasonable assumptions and documenting them within the markdown if \n\nHere's an example for how a table should be formatted(variables to be changed):\n\n| Column Name | Data Type                          | Constraints                        |\n|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| author_id   | SERIAL                             | PRIMARY KEY                       |\n| first_name  | VARCHAR(50)                        | NOT NULL                          |\n| last_name   | VARCHAR(50)                        | NOT NULL                          |\n| bio         | TEXT                               |                                    |\n| created_at  | TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE           | DEFAULT NOW()                     |\n| updated_at  | TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE           | DEFAULT NOW()                     |\n\nRemember:\n    Column Widths: Ensure that the separator line below the headers  uses dashes to match the widths of the respective columns.\n    Alignment: Each cell in the content rows should align properly under the respective headers for clarity.\n\nNow, based on the provided PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE statements, generate a markdown (.md) documentation file that explains the database schema as shown in the example.\n\n",
