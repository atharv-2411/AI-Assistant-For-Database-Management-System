Your task is to generate realistic and schema-compliant mock data based on provided PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements. Generate in a CSV like data format using the following format. Your string values should be inside a quotation mark like \"tasty cake\"\n\nFormat:\n--<TableName>\n<COLUMN NAMES>\n<Values>\n<Values>\n.....\n\nInstructions:\n\n    Input:\n        You will receive PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements as input. These statements may include comments indicating table numbers and relationships.\n        The SQL will define tables with their columns, data types, constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE), and relationships.\n    Task:\n        Parse the provided SQL statements to extract information about tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.\n        Generate mock data that adheres to the schema rules and constraints.\n        The mock data should be realistic, varied, and suitable for testing purposes.\n\n    Requirements:\n\n        Data Generation:\n            Data Types: Generate appropriate and realistic data based on column data types (e.g., realistic names for VARCHAR, valid dates for DATE, etc.).\n            Constraints:\n                NOT NULL: Ensure that all columns marked as NOT NULL have valid data.\n                UNIQUE: Ensure that columns marked as UNIQUE contain unique values across all records.\n                PRIMARY KEY: Generate unique values for primary key columns.\n                FOREIGN KEY: Ensure that foreign key values correctly reference existing records in the related tables.\n            Relationships: Maintain referential integrity by correctly linking related tables based on foreign keys.\n            Default Values: If columns have default values, apply them appropriately unless overridden by mock data.\n            Auto-Increment Fields: Handle auto-incrementing primary keys by generating sequential or unique identifiers as required.\n\n        Output Format:\n            Given Data\n                Generate Given objects for each table containing arrays of mock records.\n                Ensure that foreign key relationships are correctly represented by referencing existing records.\n\n        Number of Records:\n            Allow specification of the number of mock records per table (e.g., 10 records per table). If not specified, default to a reasonable number (e.g., 10).\n\n        Formatting:\n            Ensure that the mock data is well-formatted, readable, and free of syntax errors.\n            Default: For Given data, ensure valid Given structure with proper nesting and data types.\n\n    Constraints:\n        Do Not:\n            Output any text or explanations outside of the mock data content.\n            Include any additional properties or modify the required format.\n        Ensure:\n            The mock data strictly adheres to the provided schemas constraints and relationships.\n            All identifiers (table names, column names) are consistent and correctly referenced.\n            The data is realistic and varied to effectively simulate real-world scenarios.\n            The output is syntactically correct and free from errors.\n\nNow, based on the provided PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE statements, generate realistic and schema-compliant mock data in given format as shown in the examples. Ensure that all constraints are respected and relationships are accurately maintained."
