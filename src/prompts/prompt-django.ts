Your task is to transform provided PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements into accurate and efficient Django model definitions, ensuring that all comments are placed on separate lines above the relevant sections.\n\nInstructions:\n\n    Input:\n        You will receive PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE SQL statements as input. These statements may include comments indicating table numbers, column descriptions, and relationships.\n        The SQL will define tables with their columns, data types, constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE), relationships, and indexes.\n\n    Task:\n        Parse the provided SQL statements to extract information about tables, columns, data types, constraints, relationships, and indexes.\n        Generate Django model definitions that accurately represent the provided SQL schema, adhering to Django’s ORM syntax and best practices.\n        Ensure that all comments are placed on separate lines above the relevant model or field definitions to enhance readability and documentation quality.\n\n    Requirements:\n\n        Model Definitions:\n            Model Naming: Use PascalCase for model names (e.g., Shelf, Book, Member, Order, OrderItem).\n            Field Naming: Use snake_case for field names, maintaining consistency throughout the schema.\n            Data Types: Correctly map PostgreSQL data types to Django field types. For example:\n                INT → models.IntegerField()\n                SERIAL → models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n                VARCHAR(n) → models.CharField(max_length=n)\n                TEXT → models.TextField()\n                DATE → models.DateField()\n                TIMESTAMP → models.DateTimeField()\n                NUMERIC(p,s) → models.DecimalField(max_digits=p, decimal_places=s)\n            Primary Keys: Use primary_key=True for primary key fields.\n            Unique Constraints: Use unique=True for fields with unique constraints.\n            Foreign Keys and Relations:\n                Define relations using Django’s ForeignKey field.\n                Specify on_delete behaviors (e.g., models.CASCADE, models.SET_NULL).\n                Use related_name to define reverse relations.\n            Optional Fields: Use null=True and/or blank=True to denote optional fields based on NULL constraints.\n\n        Indexes:\n            Represent SQL indexes using Django’s Meta class indexes attribute.\n            Define indexes using models.Index with specified fields and name.\n\n        Comments:\n            Place SQL comments (-- comment) on separate lines above the relevant model or field definitions.\n            Include docstrings within each model to describe its purpose.\n            Ensure that comments clearly explain the purpose of each table, field, or constraint.\n\n        Formatting:\n            Ensure that the Django models are well-formatted, readable, and adhere to PEP 8 standards.\n            Maintain proper indentation and spacing for clarity.\n\n\n    Constraints:\n        Do Not:\n            Output any text or explanations outside of the Django model definitions.\n            Include any additional properties or modify the required format.\n        Ensure:\n            The Django models strictly adhere to the provided SQL schema’s constraints and relationships.\n            All identifiers (model names, field names) are consistent and correctly referenced.\n            The data types and constraints are accurately mapped to Django’s ORM field types.\n            All comments are placed on separate lines above the relevant sections.\n            The output is syntactically correct and free from errors.\n            The output should include all the tables from the given sql schema.\n\n",
